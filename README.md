# PythonConcurrencyTalk2016

Examples, resources, and outline for the python concurrency
and coroutines talk 2016.

### Title

A brief introduction to concurrency and coroutines in Python 3.5

### Synopsis

This is a beginner-friendly introduction to concurrent programming
in Python 3.5. Using a simple example task, differences in threaded
and cooperative approaches to concurrency will be illustrated.
The talk will then focus on how coroutines have developed in
Python from iteration protocol and generators, and how coroutines
can be used with the provisional "asyncio" event loop in the Python
standard library. It will be assumed that the listener has a basic
understanding of functions, classes, and exceptions in Python, but
no prior knowledge of concurrent programming is required.
